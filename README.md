# 2D Table Tennis Game in Python.

This project is designed to make a 2D Table Tennis Game in Python. The Game is fundamental in its
approach with minimal but standard graphics and sound. Python language is totally used to make the entire game all the graphics and sound abilities are coded in Python. As we know Python is a universal language, we can easily exploit Python's humongous libraries and Modules for our use. The code is written in an old school format where is used both programming paradigm, i.e. Procedural & Object-Oriented Style.
This Game highlights how fantastic it is to make something so real, and exhaustive through an easy
coding language.

## Software Requirements.
- Operating System - Win, Mac, Linux
- Python latest version installed, i.e. v3.9.0
- IDE or Code Editor, eg VS Code etc.

## Methodologies & Python Libraries Used. 

### I have made the game with the help of Turtle & WinSound Module.
***1. Making the Graphical Interface for the Game.***
- Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by
providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle
and this is what gives the library its name. It contains large number of classes which can be used
for different graphical representation and 2D- Game Building. The good thing about turtle is that
it’s a built-in library, so you don’t need to install any new packages. All you need to do is import the
library into your Python environment.
The turtle module provides turtle graphics primitives, in both object-oriented and procedure-
oriented ways. Because it uses tkinter for the underlying graphics, it needs a version of Python
installed with Tk support.
For More in-depth knowledge about Turtle: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html?highlight=trace#module-turtle

***2. Adding Sound to the game.***
- I used WinSound Module to add sound to my game, after a player hits the ball with paddle the
sound should come, similarly when a player misses the ball different sound should play to improve
gaming experience. Similar to Turtle good thing about Winsound is that it’s a built-in library, so you
don’t need to install any new packages. All you need to do is import the library into your Python
environment.
The winsound module provides access to the basic sound-playing machinery provided by Windows
platforms. It includes functions and several constants,
     * winsound.Beep(frequency, duration)
     * winsound.PlaySound(sound, flags)
     * winsound.MessageBeep(type=MB_OK)
     * winsound.SND_FILENAME
     * winsound.SND_ALIAS, and many more...
